    // Let's say we have an array

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players, team3);
    team3[3] = 'Fiora';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(players, team4);
    team4[3] = 'Morgana';
    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(players, team5);
    team5[3] = 'Caitlyn';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 95, age: 15});
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.age = 40;
    cap3.name = 'Jarrow Spack';
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    // If you change dev.social.twitter, it'll change wes.social.twitter too
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // This way, JSON.stringify will create a string from the object. Then JSON.parse will create a new object from this string
    // So, a new object was created and when you change twitter info, for example, the original object wont be changed.
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
